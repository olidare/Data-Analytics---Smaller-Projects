## Must Know Differences in SQL

### üìó RANK vs DENSE_RANK:
* **RANK**: Provides a ranking with gaps if there are ties.
* **DENSE_RANK**: Provides a ranking without gaps, even in the case of ties.

### üìó HAVING vs WHERE Clause:
* **WHERE**: Filters rows before grouping.
* **HAVING**: Filters groups after the `GROUP BY` clause.

### üìó UNION vs UNION ALL:
* **UNION**: Removes duplicates and combines results.
* **UNION ALL**: Combines results without removing duplicates.

### üìó JOIN vs UNION:
* **JOIN**: Combines columns from multiple tables.
* **UNION**: Combines rows from multiple tables with similar structure.

### üìó DELETE vs DROP vs TRUNCATE: üìù
* **DELETE**: Removes rows, with the option to filter.
* **DROP**: Removes the entire table or database.
* **TRUNCATE**: Deletes all rows but keeps the table structure.

### üìó COUNT() vs COUNT(*)
* **COUNT(salary)**: Counts only rows where `salary` is not `NULL`.
* **COUNT(*)**: Counts total number of rows in the result set.

### üìó CTE vs TEMP TABLE: üìù
* **CTE**: Temporary result set used within a single query.
* **TEMP TABLE**: Physical temporary table that persists for the session.

### üìó SUBQUERIES vs CTE:
* **SUBQUERIES**: Nested queries inside the main query.
* **CTE**: Can be more readable and used multiple times in a query.

### üìó HANDLE NULLS: üìù
* **ISNULL**: Used in the WHERE clause to test for NULL values. It returns TRUE if the value is NULL, and FALSE otherwise.
   * SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
* **ISNOTNULL**: Used in the WHERE clause to test for non-NULL values. It returns TRUE if the value is not NULL, and FALSE otherwise.
   * SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
* **COALESCE**: Returns the first non-NULL expression among its arguments. It can accept multiple parameters (expressions), making it more flexible than ISNULL.
   * SELECT COALESCE(column1, column2, 'DefaultValue') FROM table_name;
   * (If column1 is NULL, it tries column2; if both are NULL, it uses 'DefaultValue').

### üìó INTERSECT vs INNER JOIN: üìù
* **INTERSECT**: Returns common rows from two queries.
* **INNER JOIN**: Combines matching rows from two tables based on a condition.

### üìó LAG/LEAD vs BETWEEN WINDOW FRAME:
* **LAG/LEAD**
    * Accesses a specific row at a fixed offset from the current row.
    * Typically used to compare current vs previous/next value.
    * Works like: "give me the value 1 row back (or ahead)".

* **ROWS BETWEEN ...**
    * Defines a frame (range of rows) to perform an aggregation over, relative to the current row.
    * Typically used for running totals, moving averages, cumulative metrics.
    * Works like: "calculate over a range of rows around me".

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT
  date,
  close,
    LAG(close) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS previous_close,
    LAG(close, 3) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS three_months_ago_close,
  close - LAG(close, 3) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS three_month_diff,
  close - LAG(close) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS one_month_diff
FROM stock_prices;

SELECT
  date,
  close,
  FIRST_VALUE(close) OVER (
    ORDER BY date
    ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
  ) AS previous_close,
  FIRST_VALUE(close) OVER (
    ORDER BY date
    ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 3 PRECEDING
  ) AS three_months_ago_close,
  close - FIRST_VALUE(close) OVER (
    ORDER BY date
    ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 3 PRECEDING
  ) AS three_month_diff,
  close - FIRST_VALUE(close) OVER (
    ORDER BY date
    ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
  ) AS one_month_diff
FROM stock_prices; 
```

### üìó CTE vs WINDOW FUNCTION:

 Use a CTE when:

* You need to build an intermediate aggregated or filtered dataset
* You have multi-step logic where step 1 feeds step 2
* You‚Äôre reusing a result across multiple queries within a bigger one
* You want to clean up deeply nested subqueries 

Use a window function when:

* You need running totals, rankings, moving averages
* You want to calculate things like row_number, rank, dense_rank, lag, lead, sum over a partition
* You need to keep all the individual rows intact while adding extra insights from other rows in their "window" (partition)

``` sql
WITH follower_ranks AS (
  SELECT 
    creator_id,
    content_type,
    new_followers_count,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY content_type ORDER BY new_followers_count DESC) AS rank_in_type
  FROM fct_creator_content
)
SELECT * FROM follower_ranks
WHERE rank_in_type = 1;
```

### üìó WINDOW CLAUSE vs WINDOW FUNCTION:

Window Function	A special type of function that performs a calculation across a set of rows related to the current row (the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù)	RANK() OVER (...)
Window Clause	The part inside the OVER (...) that defines how the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù of rows is constructed 
  ‚Äî i.e. how to partition (group) and order rows for the window function	OVER (PARTITION BY content_type ORDER BY new_followers_count DESC)

The window function is when you want to calculate: RANK, SUM, etc
The window clause defines how to group/order the data for the calculation.

# Useful Functions

### CTEs 
Def: 
  
### Windows Functions 

Name of the window being referenced by the current window. The referenced window must be among the windows defined in the WINDOW clause.

The other arguments are:
* PARTITION BY that divides the query result set into partitions.
* ORDER BY that defines the logical order of the rows within each partition of the result set.
* ROWS/RANGE that limits the rows within the partition by specifying start and end points within the partition.
    
Window functions differ from regular aggregate functions as they perform operations across a set of table rows related to the current row without collapsing them into a single output row. 
The `OVER` clause is crucial here, as it specifies the window over which the function operates.

#### Basic Window Function - Rank 

``` sql
SELECT employee_id, salary,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

### WINDOW Clause

The `WINDOW` clause is used in conjunction with window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, or `SUM()` to perform calculations over a specified set of rows. 
It simplifies queries by allowing the reuse of window definitions across multiple functions.

#### Sum with Windows Clause 

``` sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER emp_window AS total_salary
FROM employees
WINDOW emp_window AS (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary);
```

### Lag & Lead Functions
Description of time-series analysis functions for accessing adjacent rows.

### ROWS BETWEEN Clause
Explanation of frame specification for window functions.

### Partitioning Data
How PARTITION BY divides data into groups for window calculations.

### Common Use Cases
Typical scenarios where window functions provide value.

### Performance Considerations
Important notes about window function performance impacts.

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

### Basic CTE Structure
Overview of CTE syntax and components.

### Recursive CTEs

A recursive CTE references itself. It returns the result subset, then it repeatedly (recursively) references itself, and stops when it returns all the results.

##### SIMPLE EXAMPLE - Months of the Year:
``` sql
WITH RecursiveMonths AS (
    SELECT
        1 AS MonthNumber,
        DATENAME(MONTH, CAST('2024-01-01' AS DATE)) AS MonthName   -- This is the first iteration (anchor member)

    UNION ALL -- Then union all the rest of results

    SELECT
        MonthNumber + 1,
        DATENAME(MONTH, DATEADD(MONTH, MonthNumber, '2024-01-01'))
    FROM RecursiveMonths
    WHERE MonthNumber < 12  -- Termination COndition
)
SELECT * FROM RecursiveMonths;
```

##### HARDER EXAMPLE Order a Company by hierarchy - Director at the Top:
``` sql
  WITH RECURSIVE company_hierarchy AS (
  SELECT    id,
            first_name,
            last_name,
            boss_id,
        0 AS hierarchy_level
  FROM employees
  WHERE boss_id IS NULL
  
  UNION ALL
  
    SELECT  
    		e.id,
            e.first_name,
            e.last_name,
            e.boss_id,
            hierarchy_level+1
  FROM employees e, company_hierarchy ch
  WHERE e.boss_id = ch.id
 )
 
SELECT ch.first_name AS employee_first_name,
       ch.last_name AS employee_last_name,
       CONCAT(e.first_name, " ", e.last_name)  AS boss_name,
       hierarchy_level
FROM company_hierarchy ch
LEFT JOIN employees e
ON ch.boss_id = e.id
ORDER BY ch.hierarchy_level, ch.boss_id;
``` 

##### In 3rd example, I‚Äôll be using the table cities_route, which contains data about Dutch cities:

| city_from    | city_to       | distance |
|--------------|---------------|----------|
| Groningen    | Heerenveen    | 61.4     |
| Groningen    | Harlingen     | 91.6     |
| Harlingen    | Wieringerwerf | 52.3     |
| Wieringerwerf| Hoorn         | 26.5     |
| Hoorn        | Amsterdam     | 46.1     |
| Amsterdam    | Haarlem       | 30.0     |
| Heerenveen   | Lelystad      | 74.0     |
| Lelystad     | Amsterdam     | 57.2     |

Use this table to find all the possible routes from Groningen to Haarlem, showing the cities on the route and the total distance.

Here‚Äôs the query to solve this problem:

``` sql
WITH RECURSIVE possible_route AS (

  -- Anchor member
  SELECT 
    cd.city_to,
    CONCAT(cd.city_from, '->', cd.city_to) AS route,
    cd.distance
  FROM city_distances cd
  WHERE cd.city_from = 'Groningen'

  UNION ALL

  -- Recursive member
  SELECT 
    cd.city_to,   -- where you are now
    CAST(CONCAT(pr.route, '->', cd.city_to) AS CHAR(1000)) AS route,  -- build the route
    CAST((pr.distance + cd.distance) AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) -- sum the distance
  FROM possible_route pr.  -- previous recursion result
  INNER JOIN city_distances cd
    ON cd.city_from = pr.city_to
  WHERE pr.route NOT LIKE CONCAT('%', cd.city_to, '%') -- to avoid loops, you can track visited cities 

)

SELECT pr.route, pr.distance
FROM possible_route pr
WHERE pr.city_to = 'Haarlem'
ORDER BY pr.distance;
