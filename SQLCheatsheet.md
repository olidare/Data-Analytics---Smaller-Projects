## Must Know Differences in SQL

### üìó RANK vs DENSE_RANK:
* **RANK**: Provides a ranking with gaps if there are ties.
* **DENSE_RANK**: Provides a ranking without gaps, even in the case of ties.

### üìó HAVING vs WHERE Clause:
* **WHERE**: Filters rows before grouping.
* **HAVING**: Filters groups after the `GROUP BY` clause.

### üìó UNION vs UNION ALL:
* **UNION**: Removes duplicates and combines results.
* **UNION ALL**: Combines results without removing duplicates.

### üìó JOIN vs UNION:
* **JOIN**: Combines columns from multiple tables.
* **UNION**: Combines rows from multiple tables with similar structure.

### üìó DELETE vs DROP vs TRUNCATE: üìù
* **DELETE**: Removes rows, with the option to filter.
* **DROP**: Removes the entire table or database.
* **TRUNCATE**: Deletes all rows but keeps the table structure.

### üìó COUNT() vs COUNT(*)
* **COUNT(salary)**: Counts only rows where `salary` is not `NULL`.
* **COUNT(*)**: Counts total number of rows in the result set.

### üìó CTE vs TEMP TABLE: üìù
* **CTE**: Temporary result set used within a single query.
* **TEMP TABLE**: Physical temporary table that persists for the session.

### üìó SUBQUERIES vs CTE:
* **SUBQUERIES**: Nested queries inside the main query.
* **CTE**: Can be more readable and used multiple times in a query.

### üìó ISNULL vs COALESCE: üìù
* **ISNULL**: Replaces `NULL` with a specified value, accepts two parameters.
* **COALESCE**: Returns the first non-`NULL` value from a list of expressions, accepting multiple parameters.

### üìó INTERSECT vs INNER JOIN: üìù
* **INTERSECT**: Returns common rows from two queries.
* **INNER JOIN**: Combines matching rows from two tables based on a condition.

### üìó LAG/LEAD vs BETWEEN WINDOW FRAME:
* **LAG/LEAD**
    * Accesses a specific row at a fixed offset from the current row.
    * Typically used to compare current vs previous/next value.
    * Works like: "give me the value 1 row back (or ahead)".

* **ROWS BETWEEN ...**
    * Defines a frame (range of rows) to perform an aggregation over, relative to the current row.
    * Typically used for running totals, moving averages, cumulative metrics.
    * Works like: "calculate over a range of rows around me".

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT
  date,
  close,
    LAG(close) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS previous_close,
    LAG(close, 3) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS three_months_ago_close,
  close - LAG(close, 3) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS three_month_diff,
  close - LAG(close) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS one_month_diff
FROM stock_prices;

SELECT
  date,
  close,
  FIRST_VALUE(close) OVER (
    ORDER BY date
    ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
  ) AS previous_close,
  FIRST_VALUE(close) OVER (
    ORDER BY date
    ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 3 PRECEDING
  ) AS three_months_ago_close,
  close - FIRST_VALUE(close) OVER (
    ORDER BY date
    ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 3 PRECEDING
  ) AS three_month_diff,
  close - FIRST_VALUE(close) OVER (
    ORDER BY date
    ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
  ) AS one_month_diff
FROM stock_prices;
