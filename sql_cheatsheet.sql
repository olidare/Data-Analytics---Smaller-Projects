  # Must Know difference in SQL

###################################################################################################################################################
  

üìó RANK vs DENSE_RANK:
RANK: Provides a ranking with gaps if there are ties.
DENSE_RANK: Provides a ranking without gaps, even in the case of ties.

üìó HAVING vs WHERE Clause:
WHERE: Filters rows before grouping.
HAVING: Filters groups after the GROUP BY clause.

üìó UNION vs UNION ALL:
UNION: Removes duplicates and combines results.
UNION ALL: Combines results without removing duplicates.

üìó JOIN vs UNION:
JOIN: Combines columns from multiple tables.
UNION: Combines rows from multiple tables with similar structure.

üìó DELETE vs DROP vs TRUNCATE: üìù
DELETE: Removes rows, with the option to filter.
DROP: Removes the entire table or database.
TRUNCATE: Deletes all rows but keeps the table structure.

üìó COUNT() vs COUNT(*)
COUNT(salary): ‚Äî counts only rows where salary is not NULL
COUNT(*): ‚Äî counts total number of rows in the result set
  
üìó CTE vs TEMP TABLE: üìù
CTE: Temporary result set used within a single query.
TEMP TABLE: Physical temporary table that persists for the session.

üìó SUBQUERIES vs CTE:
SUBQUERIES: Nested queries inside the main query.
CTE: Can be more readable and used multiple times in a query.

üìó ISNULL vs COALESCE: üìù
ISNULL: Replaces NULL with a specified value, accepts two parameters.
COALESCE: Returns the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions, accepting multiple parameters.

üìó INTERSECT vs INNER JOIN: üìù
INTERSECT: Returns common rows from two queries.
INNER JOIN: Combines matching rows from two tables based on a condition.

  
üìó LAG/LEAD vs BETWEEN WINDOW FRAME:
LAG/LEAD	                                                            ROWS BETWEEN ...
Accesses a specific row at a fixed offset from the current row	    Defines a frame (range of rows) to perform an aggregation over, relative to the current row
Typically used to compare current vs previous/next value	          Typically used for running totals, moving averages, cumulative metrics
Works like: ‚Äúgive me the value 1 row back (or ahead)‚Äù	              Works like: ‚Äúcalculate over a range of rows around me‚Äù

SELECT
  date,
  close,
    LAG(close) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS previous_close,
    LAG(close, 3) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS three_months_ago_close,
  close - LAG(close, 3) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS three_month_diff,
  close - LAG(close) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS one_month_diff
FROM stock_prices

  SELECT
  date,
  close,
  FIRST_VALUE(close) OVER (
    ORDER BY date 
    ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
  ) AS previous_close,
  FIRST_VALUE(close) OVER (
    ORDER BY date 
    ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 3 PRECEDING
  ) AS three_months_ago_close,
  close - FIRST_VALUE(close) OVER (
    ORDER BY date 
    ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 3 PRECEDING
  ) AS three_month_diff,
  close - FIRST_VALUE(close) OVER (
    ORDER BY date 
    ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
  ) AS one_month_diff
FROM stock_prices
  
üìó CTE vs WINDOW FUNCTION:

 Use a CTE when:

* You need to build an intermediate aggregated or filtered dataset
* You have multi-step logic where step 1 feeds step 2
* You‚Äôre reusing a result across multiple queries within a bigger one
* You want to clean up deeply nested subqueries 

Use a window function when:

* You need running totals, rankings, moving averages
* You want to calculate things like row_number, rank, dense_rank, lag, lead, sum over a partition
* You need to keep all the individual rows intact while adding extra insights from other rows in their "window" (partition)

  e.g.
WITH follower_ranks AS (
  SELECT 
    creator_id,
    content_type,
    new_followers_count,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY content_type ORDER BY new_followers_count DESC) AS rank_in_type
  FROM fct_creator_content
)
SELECT * FROM follower_ranks
WHERE rank_in_type = 1;

üìó WINDOW CLAUSE vs WINDOW FUNCTION:

Window Function	A special type of function that performs a calculation across a set of rows related to the current row (the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù)	RANK() OVER (...)
Window Clause	The part inside the OVER (...) that defines how the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù of rows is constructed 
  ‚Äî i.e. how to partition (group) and order rows for the window function	OVER (PARTITION BY content_type ORDER BY new_followers_count DESC)

The window function is when you want to calculate: RANK, SUM, etc
The window clause defines how to group/order the data for the calculation.

  # Useful Function

--###################################################################################################################################################

  
#### CTEs ####
Def: 
  
#### Windows Functions #####

Name of the window being referenced by the current window. The referenced window must be among the windows defined in the WINDOW clause.

The other arguments are:
* PARTITION BY that divides the query result set into partitions.
* ORDER BY that defines the logical order of the rows within each partition of the result set.
* ROWS/RANGE that limits the rows within the partition by specifying start and end points within the partition.
    
Window functions differ from regular aggregate functions as they perform operations across a set of table rows related to the current row without collapsing them into a single output row. 
The `OVER` clause is crucial here, as it specifies the window over which the function operates.

# Basic Window Function - Rank #
SELECT employee_id, salary,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;

The `WINDOW` clause is used in conjunction with window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, or `SUM()` to perform calculations over a specified set of rows. 
It simplifies queries by allowing the reuse of window definitions across multiple functions.

# Sum with Windows Clause #
  
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER emp_window AS total_salary
FROM employees
WINDOW emp_window AS (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary);

# Running total of followers per content_type  #
  
SELECT 
  content_type,
  published_date,
  new_followers_count,
  SUM(new_followers_count) OVER (PARTITION BY content_type ORDER BY published_date) AS running_total_followers
FROM fct_creator_content;

# Lag & Lead #

LEAD() and LAG() are time-series window functions used to access data from rows that come after, or before the current row within a result set based on a specific column order.

  
# RANK #

SELECT 
 artist_name, 
 concert_revenue, 
 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY concert_revenue) AS row_num,
 RANK() OVER (ORDER BY concert_revenue) AS rank_num,
 DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY concert_revenue) AS dense_rank_num
FROM concerts;


  
# ROWS BETWEEN lower_bound AND upper_bound #

ref: https://learnsql.com/blog/sql-window-functions-rows-clause/ 
  
The bounds can be any of these five options:

* UNBOUNDED PRECEDING ‚Äì All rows before the current row.
* n PRECEDING ‚Äì n rows before the current row.
* CURRENT ROW ‚Äì Just the current row.
* n FOLLOWING ‚Äì n rows after the current row.
* UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING ‚Äì All rows after the current row.

ex1 - we want to add another column that shows the total revenue from the first date up to the current row‚Äôs date (i.e. running total). 
SELECT date, revenue,
    SUM(revenue) OVER (
      ORDER BY date
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) running_total
FROM sales
ORDER BY date;

ex2 - We want to calculate the three-days moving average temperature separately for each city. 
  SELECT city, date, temperature,
      ROUND(AVG(temperature) OVER (
        PARTITION BY city
        ORDER BY date DESC
        ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 2 FOLLOWING), 1) mov_avg_3d_city
  FROM weather
  ORDER BY city, date;

  ex3 - we‚Äôll calculate the total precipitation for the last three days (i.e. a three-day running total) separately for two cities.

  SELECT city, date, precipitation,
    SUM(precipitation) OVER (
      PARTITION BY city
      ORDER BY date
      ROWS 2 PRECEDING) running_total_3d_city
FROM weather
ORDER BY city, date;
  
  ex4 -  we define the window frame as UNBOUNDED PRECEDING to include all records up to the current one inclusively.

SELECT social_network, date, new_subscribers,
    SUM(new_subscribers) OVER (
      PARTITION BY social_network
      ORDER BY date
      ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) running_total_network
FROM subscribers
ORDER BY social_network, date;

  ex5 - display the first and the last value of a specific set of records using window functions and the ROWS clause. 

  SELECT social_network, date, new_subscribers,
    FIRST_VALUE(new_subscribers) OVER(
      PARTITION BY social_network
      ORDER BY date) AS first_day,
    LAST_VALUE(new_subscribers) OVER(
      PARTITION BY social_network
      ORDER BY date
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_day
FROM subscribers
ORDER BY social_network, date;

we do specify the window frame with the LAST_VALUE() function because the default option would use the current row value as the last value for each record;
this is not what we are looking for in this example. 
We specify the window frame as ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING to make sure all records are considered.

  And here‚Äôs the result set:

date	social_network	new_subscribers	first_day	last_day
2021-09-01	Facebook	12	12	28
2021-09-02	Facebook	23	12	28
2021-09-03	Facebook	25	12	28
2021-09-04	Facebook	28	12	28

2021-09-02	Instagram	67	40	85
2021-09-03	Instagram	34	40	85
2021-09-04	Instagram	85	40	85
2021-09-01	LinkedIn	5	5	20
2021-09-02	LinkedIn	2	5	20

#### SELF JOINS #####


#### UNION ####


#### RECURSIVE CTE ####

# Anchor Member Execution: The CTE starts its execution with the anchor member which is a non recursive query. It initializes the initial rows of the CTE that serves as the starting point of the recursion.
# Recursive Member Execution(Iterations): The recursive member mainly consists of the SELECT statement that references the CTE itself. Each iteration uses the results that were obtained in the previous iteration or the initial anchor member.This process is repeated until a termination condition is met.
# Termination Condition Check: The termination condition is essential for the termination of the recursive query in the CTE or else our query can get stuck in an infinite loop. This mainly consists of WHERE clause that filters the rows. When the termination condition is met the recursive member halts the execution and returns the result set.
# Union Result Sets: The UNION ALL operator combines the results from the anchor member as well as the results obtained from all of the iterations of the recursive member. At this step the final result set is prepared which will be returned to the user.
# Return Final Result: Finally the result set formed in the previous steps is returned to the user as the output generated by the recursive CTE.

SIMPLE EXAMPLE - Months of the Year:

WITH RecursiveMonths AS (
    SELECT
        1 AS MonthNumber,
        DATENAME(MONTH, CAST('2024-01-01' AS DATE)) AS MonthName   -- This is the first iteration (anchor member)

    UNION ALL -- Then union all the rest of results

    SELECT
        MonthNumber + 1,
        DATENAME(MONTH, DATEADD(MONTH, MonthNumber, '2024-01-01'))
    FROM RecursiveMonths
    WHERE MonthNumber < 12  -- Termination COndition
)
SELECT * FROM RecursiveMonths;

----

HARDER EXAMPLE:



  
#### PIVOT #####

The PIVOT operation is typically used when you need to convert row data into columns for better analytical insight, often employing custom SQL queries or stored procedures. 
The syntax involves using aggregate functions and CASE statements to simulate a PIVOT table.

The PIVOT clause in MySQL is not natively supported as a direct SQL command but can be simulated to transform rows into columns.
  
In Postgres (use dedicated function):
SELECT 
  UNNEST(ARRAY['likes', 'shares', 'comments']),
  UNNEST(ARRAY[100, 20, 30])

In MySQL:

#Basic Example
SELECT 
  department,
  SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Jan' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS Jan_Sales,
  SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Feb' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS Feb_Sales
FROM 
  sales_data
GROUP BY 
  department;

# Dynamic Example when number of Columns not known
SET @sql = NULL;
SELECT
  GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT
    CONCAT(
      'SUM(CASE WHEN month = ''',
      month,
      ''' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS ',
      CONCAT(month, '_Sales')
    )
  ) INTO @sql
FROM sales_data;

SET @sql = CONCAT('SELECT department, ', @sql, ' FROM sales_data GROUP BY department');

PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
EXECUTE stmt;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;

#### STORED PROCEDURE // FUNCTION ####

# DEF #
A stored procedure is a saved, precompiled block of SQL code that you can call and execute whenever you need it ‚Äî optionally passing in parameters.
Functions are designed to encapsulate calculations or transformations and return the result.

Functions follow the computer-science definition in that they MUST return a value and cannot alter the data they receive as parameters (the arguments). 
Functions are not allowed to change anything, must have at least one parameter, and they must return a value. 
Stored procs do not have to have a parameter, can change database objects, and do not have to return a value.
  
Stored procedures are designed for performing data manipulation and database operations, 
while functions are designed for returning a single value, often the result of a calculation or transformation

  # PROCEDURE EXAMPLE
  
  CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30), @PostalCode nvarchar(10)
  AS
  SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City AND PostalCode = @PostalCode
  GO;
  
  EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London', @PostalCode = 'WA1 1DP';

  
  # FUNCTION EXAMPLE  

  Let‚Äôs say you want a function that calculates an engagement score for each content item based on a weighted formula:
  engagement_score = (likes_count * 2) + (comments_count * 3) + (shares_count * 5)

  # Build Function
    DELIMITER $$
  
  CREATE FUNCTION calculate_engagement_score(
    likes INT,
    comments INT,
    shares INT
  )
  RETURNS INT
  DETERMINISTIC
  BEGIN
    DECLARE engagement_score INT;
  
    SET engagement_score = (likes * 2) + (comments * 3) + (shares * 5);
  
    RETURN engagement_score;
  END$$
  
  DELIMITER ;

  # How to Use:
    SELECT 
  content_id,
  content_type,
  likes_count,
  comments_count,
  shares_count,
  calculate_engagement_score(likes_count, comments_count, shares_count) AS engagement_score
FROM fct_creator_content;



#### DELIMETER ####

When you're writing multi-statement SQL blocks like stored procedures, functions, or triggers ‚Äî you need a way to tell MySQL where the end of your entire block is.

By default, MySQL considers the semicolon ; as the end of a statement.
But inside a stored procedure or function, you're going to use a bunch of semicolons to separate individual statements.
So ‚Äî you need to temporarily change the statement terminator to something else while you're defining the procedure/function

  DELIMITER $$     -- Tell MySQL: "For now, don't treat semicolons as end of statement.

CREATE FUNCTION my_function()
RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  DECLARE my_variable INT;
  SET my_variable = 10;
  RETURN my_variable;
END$$           -- Here's the actual end of the entire function definition.

DELIMITER ;     -- Put it back to normal for regular SQL statements.

  
#### INDEXING ####


  
#### ANALYZE ####

`ANALYZE TABLE` is typically used when there are significant changes in the data distribution within a table, such as after a large number of insertions, deletions, or updates.
It helps ensure that the query optimizer has the most accurate data to make informed decisions.

ANALYZE TABLE orders, customers;


#### EXPLAIN ####

The `EXPLAIN` statement in MySQL is a performance optimization tool used to provide insight into how MySQL executes a query. 
It helps developers understand the execution plan and optimize queries for better performance.

  
EXPLAIN SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
WHERE orders.date > '2023-01-01';

#### EXPLAIN ANALYZE ####

The MySQL EXPLAIN ANALYZE command provides information about the query execution plan, including specifics about the optimizers decisions, access methods, and estimated costs. 
  EXPLAIN ANALYZE is a useful tool for query performance study since it performs the query and offers runtime information, unlike EXPLAIN, which only presents the process plan without actually executing the query.
  
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
